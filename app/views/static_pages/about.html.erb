<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> is a project by Michael Hartl to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
</p>
<p>Having completed the functionality from the tutorial, my goal is to extend the application's functionality as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>make pages responsive so that the site is easier to navigate on mobile devices</li>
</ul>
